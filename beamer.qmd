## Introduction

::::: {.columns align="center" totalwidth="8em"}
::: {.column width="80%"}
Hello,

-   My name is **Dhanushka** and my friends call me *Dhanush*. I was born on 5^th^ of June, in 1996. I am officially from [**Sri Lanka**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka). I grew in a small town called [Panadura](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Panadura,+Sri+Lanka/@6.7291197,79.8882363,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3ae24616c169e7c3:0xd21e80c970651d56!8m2!3d6.7106361!4d79.9074262!16s%2Fm%2F02vrtzb?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

-   Well, Its a tropical island üèùÔ∏è located in the South Indian Ocean. Its is even called the Perl of the Indian ocean. Frankly speaking, It is a paradise. You can experience all kinds of weather conditions there. (Give it a try if you want to explore)

-   Currently I am reading for my **PhD in Statistics**, at UNL. I will probably be able to graduate in 5 years from now.

## My favourite Animal

Honestly, I love lions.

## Generate a plot

Here we are using Iris dataset, and let's create a scatter-plot to identify the relationship between **Petal Length vs. Petal Width** for different **species**.



```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

data("iris")

# Plot using geom_text to show emojis
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, colour = Species)) + 
geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Petal Length vs. Petal Width",
       x = "Petal Length", 
       y = "Petal Width") +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "black", size = 12, face = "bold"),                    axis.line = element_line(colour = "black", linewidth = 1), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(colour = "red", size = 13, face = "bold"), 
        axis.title.y = element_text(colour = "red", size = 13, face = "bold"), 
        plot.title = element_text(colour = "black", face = "bold", hjust = 0.5, size= 15), 
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = NULL, color = "blue"), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(color = "black", face = "bold", size = 10), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10))


```
